# Summary of First Deliverable: POS System for "El Criollito" Restaurant

This document outlines the planning and initial analysis of an integrated order management system for the restaurant "El Criollito." The main goal is to optimize operational efficiency and enhance customer experience in a dynamic and competitive restaurant environment.

## 1. Introduction

The project aims to develop a comprehensive system that streamlines all stages of the ordering process, from customer input to final bill issuance. The software will allow diners to interact via a user-friendly interface to customize and send orders directly to the kitchen in real time, reducing errors and improving communication accuracy.

It will also include table and reservation management, automatic bill generation, and dynamic menu administration.
